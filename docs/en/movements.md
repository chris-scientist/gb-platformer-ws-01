# Step 2 - Movement management

## Introduction

In this second step, we will animate the character by implementing the moves :
* go right ;
* go left ;
* jump.

*I invite you to download <a href="https://github.com/chris-scientist/gb-platformer-workshop-01/archive/v1.0.zip" class="external-link" >the code</a> which is the result of the first step in order to start on a common basis.*

## Move to the right or left

Work in progress...
